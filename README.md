# 🗂️ Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-ML-Project
Predicting bank customer churn using machine learning to help businesses retain high-risk customers.
---
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer will leave a bank (churn), based on demographic and account-related data. Churn prediction helps banks retain high-value customers by identifying early signs of dissatisfaction.
